- 👋 Hi, I’m @HadenBruce
- 👀 I’m interested in coding and tinkering 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning networking and playing with raspberry pi projects and picking up what I can at my job and online
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a smart mirror project with a raspberry pi, as it would be my first attempt at a project like that.
- 📫 I can be reached @hadenzbruce@gmail.com, if anyone is looking to give input!
